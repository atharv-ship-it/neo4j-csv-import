I can reach the page in your last message fine. See -Page 0-    Wich I couldn't do the prior days. Fixed for me.

"This is a Chromebook, not an Inspiron.  First thing to try is a Powerwash/factory reset (you will lose everything on the system when you do this).

If that doesn't solve the problem, it either needs a hardware repair, or replacement.

Btw, thanks for suggestion

To clarify, the system is not hanging during boot. The failure happens before POST.

Each time I press the power button, only the Caps Lock LED turns on for ~3 seconds and then the laptop goes completely dead again. Repeating this cycle multiple times over 5–10 minutes eventually allows the EC to complete power initialization and the system finally turns on.

This occurs before BIOS or any boot device is accessed, so no OS, disk, or filesystem activity is involved. Once the laptop powers on, it boots normally.

I ve confirmed this is a hardware power-initialization issue: the CPU fan has failed, and the previous Dell charger died due to a DC-side cable short (brick → pin), which likely stressed the DC-in/EC circuitry. Because the issue is at EC/power-rail level, testing with another OS wouldn’t isolate it.",princekatariya09,2026-01-23T09:16:00Z,Vostro,No Boot Problem,https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/vostro/no-boot-problem/696fa4c8e3d7950ef0540149,False,Dell Forums,2026-01-28T09:53:07.765Z,False,False

"I have a wonky touch pad where the left side leans downwards. This isn't the actual image, this is just an illustration.

As you can see, like in the image, this creates a gap along the edge, (on the left side), whilst the right side of the touchpad remains flushed with the palm rest. When operating the thing, when I left click on the touchpad, I would often have to pressure press for a response. When I close the lid and inspect the innards, I find no issue that I can see. I open the lid, and I find dust on my screen.

So, I remove the battery. The battery looks dusty. I clean it. I remove the touchpad. The touch pad is straight, and there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the bracket which holds the touch pad in place either.

I think the body might be warped.

I've checked the hinges, the screen, the lid, removed the bezel, checked the hinges.... EVE RY THINN G... and still, I cannot find the cause of the wonky touchpad or warped body issue. I do think the body is warped somehow?

I cannot solve this. Any ideas? 🙏

"@mattyb3  
Thank you for your response.

I would like to clarify that the issue is not limited to GPU switching or a Windows update.

The system experiences VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR (0x113), black screens, and visual artifacts while completely idle, with no applications running.

This occurs repeatedly, including after a clean OS reinstall and after servicing.

The following steps have already been performed:

Clean uninstall and reinstall of both AMD and NVIDIA graphics drivers
Testing with NVIDIA GPU only
System restart and clean environment
Device has already been serviced, yet the issue persists

Given that the crashes occur without load, after reinstall, and post-service, this strongly indicates a hardware-level fault, most likely related to VRAM or the GPU subsystem on the motherboard, rather than a driver or Windows update issue.",user_80008e,2026-01-23T08:52:00Z,Alienware,"m18, error",https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/alienware/m18-error/69728c40dd7dc95c268abc8f,False,Dell Forums,2026-01-28T09:58:11.573Z,False,False

"Hey [@Sifujon,](https://www.dell.com/community/en/users/69719cea918dc91cb4b53994) everthing good? So, maybe the issue is about the drivers, a Windows driver could be overriding the device one, so AWCC is not detecting it.

You can check it by following this steps:

- Open **Device Manager** (`Win + X` > Device Manager).
- Expand **Sound, video and game controllers**.
- Look for your headset.

  - **If it says ""USB Audio Device""**: This is the problem.

  - **If it says ""Alienware AW510H""**: The driver is present, but the AWCC service isn't talking to it.

If it is **""USB Audio Device""**, the generic one, try downloading and installing the device driver directly from the [Dell Support Page](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us).

"I purchased an Alienware, Area 51 Laptop in September. It is the best of the best that they offer. By November, my computer was freezing and causing significant issues on very important work calls with clients. Turns out that the motherboard needed to be replaced. At Dell's direction, I took it to an authorized repair shop and go it replaced. Brought the computer home and within an hour the motherboard went out again. Dell then sent an in-home tech to replace the motherboard and hard drive. An hour after they left, the power button wasn't working. They sent a new tech this morning to replace the power button, but they guy said there are broken pieces on the 3rd motherboard (obviously poorly refurbished).

I'm now needing multiple items replaced, likely the motherboard, power button...who knows what else.

Dell will not replace this lemon. I'm about to be on my 4th motherboard for a computer I've owned for 4 months and only been able to be used for 2 months. My new computer is now scratched up, lights don't work, etc...not to mention the many hours and billable time I've lost from my small business dealing with this thing.

At this point, it makes zero financial sense for Dell to keep fixing this computer. It's beyond me why they won't do the right thing and send me a new computer. _<Dell policy states that a NEW Area-51 laptop exchange is only done while still inside the FIRST 30 days from the Dell invoice date.

"Hello,

I would like to ask for advice regarding a RAM compatibility issue with my Dell Precision 3571 laptop.

I purchased the following memory module:

Kingston FURY SO-DIMM 32GB DDR5-4800MHz CL38 Impact

(Part number: KF548S38IB-32)

According to the specifications, this module should be compatible with the Precision 3571. However, the laptop does not seem to accept it.

Observed behavior:

- After installing the module, the laptop powers on but shows only a black screen
- After a few automatic restarts, the front LED starts blinking, indicating “Invalid memory installed”
- We tested the module in both RAM slots, with the same result
- We also disconnected and reconnected the CMOS/battery, but this did not help
- Reinstalling the original memory immediately restores normal operation

The system otherwise works fine with the original RAM.

Does anyone know what could cause this behavior?

Is this a known compatibility issue with certain DDR5 modules, or are there specific RAM part numbers that are known to work reliably with the Precision 3571?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",user_0322c8,2026-01-23T08:16:00Z,Precision,Dell Precision 3571 does not accept Kingston FURY DDR5-4800 32GB RAM – “Invalid memory installed”,https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/precision-mobile-workstations/dell-precision-3571-does-not-accept-kingston-fury-ddr5-4800-32gb-ram-invalid-memory-installed/69737491e153922c02639ea7,True,Dell Forums,2026-01-28T10:03:22.885Z,,

"Hi,

The fan on the left side of my laptop makes a strong noise. In the beginning it was only during startup, but now it is creeping more and more during normal activity and I think it will need to be replaced soon.

Is there any replacement that I can buy directly from dell? From what I've found on the web the fan is called 7DDM8 but I can't find any on the official website and I think I might be wrong. ( https://www.dell.com/en-us/shopping/replacement-pc-fans ). If there are no replacement for specific for this model is there any other fan I can use for this purpose?

Troubleshooting Continuous Laptop Restarts

If your laptop is restarting continuously, follow these steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Check Power Supply**:

   - Ensure the power cable is securely connected.
   - Reseat the power cable and any external devices.
2. **Remove External Peripherals**:

   - Disconnect all external devices (USB drives, printers, etc.) and restart the laptop.
3. **Boot into Safe Mode**:

   - Try booting into Safe Mode to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is software-related.
4. **Check for BIOS Recovery**:

   - If your laptop supports BIOS recovery, follow the steps to initiate recovery. This may resolve issues related to BIOS corruption.
5. **Inspect for Hardware Issues**:

   - Look for any blinking LED patterns that may indicate hardware failures. Common patterns include:
     - **3 blinks, then 6 blinks**: BIOS corruption.
     - **3 blinks, then 7 blinks**: BIOS/CPU failure.
6. **Reset BIOS Settings**:

   - Access the BIOS by pressing F2 during startup. Restore BIOS settings to factory defaults.
7. **System Maintenance**:

   - Perform system maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Refer to Dell's optimization and maintenance resources.
8. **Contact Dell Support**:

   - If the issue persists after trying these steps, it may be necessary to contact Dell Technical Support for further assistance or potential repairs.

"Hi everyone,

I have a Dell Vostro 14 3430 (Windows 11) which is about 1 year and 4 months old. My current battery health is around 82% with 271 cycles.

I am a student/developer and I use my laptop for long hours. I heard that I should use the ""Primarily AC Use"" setting in Dell Power Manager and keep the laptop plugged in all the time to save battery cycles.

My questions are:

1. Is it safe to keep the laptop plugged in 24/7 with this setting enabled?

2. Will this stop further battery degradation, or will it damage the battery due to heat?

3. Does the laptop actually bypass the battery and run on AC power in this mode?

"No notebook is designed to be run 24/7 -- that alone will shorten its lifespan markedly. That includes not just the battery but all internal components.

It's safe in that the charging cuts off at 100% (or at whatever level you choose with the power manager -- there's no safety hazard.

No, there's no way to stop normal battery degradation. 18% in 16 months is pretty much normal -- the battery will last 2-3 years before it loses too much capacity to be useful.

When plugged in, the system uses AC power by default. Primarily AC reduces the charging duration to help with the battery lifespan.

Be sure you do occasionally use the system in battery only (unplugged). Other than that, and the fact that you're using the system for a duty cycle in excess of its design parameters, there should be no issue.",ejn63,2025-12-18T07:13:00Z,Vostro,"Is ""Primarily AC Use"" safe for keeping Vostro 14 3430 plugged in 24/7?",https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/vostro/is-primarily-ac-use-safe-for-keeping-vostro-14-3430-plugged-in-247/6943c6eade43d316953ba8b4,False,Dell Forums,2026-01-28T10:05:10.523Z,False,False

"My out of warranty Dell XPS 15 9510 was purchased Nov 2021 from Canada. After only 1.5 years, the laptop began failing (stuck on Dell logo, required force restarts). Later it completely shut down.

I’ve been contacting multiple Indian service centres for almost 2 years now, but no motherboard availability and no resolution. This is very disappointing for a premium Dell product.
