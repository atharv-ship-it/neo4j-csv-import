Sorry for my late answer.

I can reach the page in your last message fine. See -Page 0-    Wich I couldn't do the prior days. Fixed for me.

From there I can reach -Page 1-   Good.

Then if I click to Automatic update I go to -Page 2- OOOPS but when I click to drivers I reach the drivers list.

I understand that Automatic Update isn't working as it should.

Btw, thanks for suggestion

To clarify, the system is not hanging during boot. The failure happens before POST.

Each time I press the power button, only the Caps Lock LED turns on for ~3 seconds and then the laptop goes completely dead again. Repeating this cycle multiple times over 5–10 minutes eventually allows the EC to complete power initialization and the system finally turns on.

This occurs before BIOS or any boot device is accessed, so no OS, disk, or filesystem activity is involved. Once the laptop powers on, it boots normally.

I ve confirmed this is a hardware power-initialization issue: the CPU fan has failed, and the previous Dell charger died due to a DC-side cable short (brick → pin), which likely stressed the DC-in/EC circuitry. Because the issue is at EC/power-rail level, testing with another OS wouldn’t isolate it.",2026-01-23T09:16:00Z,,

Other than a graphics driver issue, it could also be due to a Windows update. You could try using a system restore point to go back to a time before the issue started.

If you haven't already, uninstall both graphics drivers and reinstall. You can also try using the Nvidia control panel to set all actions to use the Nvidia card. This will reduce your battery life when you're not plugged in though.

Thank you for your response.

I would like to clarify that the issue is not limited to GPU switching or a Windows update.

The system experiences VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR (0x113), black screens, and visual artifacts while completely idle, with no applications running.

This occurs repeatedly, including after a clean OS reinstall and after servicing.

The following steps have already been performed:

Clean uninstall and reinstall of both AMD and NVIDIA graphics drivers
Testing with NVIDIA GPU only
System restart and clean environment
Device has already been serviced, yet the issue persists

Given that the crashes occur without load, after reinstall, and post-service, this strongly indicates a hardware-level fault, most likely related to VRAM or the GPU subsystem on the motherboard, rather than a driver or Windows update issue.",2026-01-23T08:52:00Z,,
https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/alienware/aw510h-headset-doesnt-show-in-awcc/69719d8d918dc91cb4b546c7,All G,"Hey [@Sifujon,](https://www.dell.com/community/en/users/69719cea918dc91cb4b53994) everthing good? So, maybe the issue is about the drivers, a Windows driver could be overriding the device one, so AWCC is not detecting it.

You can check it by following this steps:

- Open **Device Manager** (`Win + X` > Device Manager).
- Expand **Sound, video and game controllers**.
- Look for your headset.

  - **If it says ""USB Audio Device""**: This is the problem.

  - **If it says ""Alienware AW510H""**: The driver is present, but the AWCC service isn't talking to it.

If it is **""USB Audio Device""**, the generic one, try downloading and installing the device driver directly from the [Dell Support Page](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us).

Also, when you tried to reinstall the AWCC, did you do it like in [this video](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178439/how-to-remove-and-reinstall-the-alienware-command-center)? There are some steps that make it a ""clean installation"", which should resolve any bugs or issues with it.

Troubleshooting Continuous Laptop Restarts

If your laptop is restarting continuously, follow these steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Check Power Supply**:

   - Ensure the power cable is securely connected.
   - Reseat the power cable and any external devices.
2. **Remove External Peripherals**:

   - Disconnect all external devices (USB drives, printers, etc.) and restart the laptop.
3. **Boot into Safe Mode**:

   - Try booting into Safe Mode to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is software-related.
4. **Check for BIOS Recovery**:

   - If your laptop supports BIOS recovery, follow the steps to initiate recovery. This may resolve issues related to BIOS corruption.
5. **Inspect for Hardware Issues**:

   - Look for any blinking LED patterns that may indicate hardware failures. Common patterns include:
     - **3 blinks, then 6 blinks**: BIOS corruption.
     - **3 blinks, then 7 blinks**: BIOS/CPU failure.
6. **Reset BIOS Settings**:

   - Access the BIOS by pressing F2 during startup. Restore BIOS settings to factory defaults.
7. **System Maintenance**:

   - Perform system maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Refer to Dell's optimization and maintenance resources.
8. **Contact Dell Support**:

   - If the issue persists after trying these steps, it may be necessary to contact Dell Technical Support for further assistance or potential repairs.

Both battery powered devices so I highly doubt they have ASPM disabled globally, there must be some vendor driver or BIOS configuration that is fixing the issue.

Also why do I have to accept a newer device being less compatible with Thunderbolt devices than my 4 year old Dell 9315 which ran this same eGPU flawlessly.

Dell needs to investigate this issue and provide some sort of firmware/driver fix",2026-01-26T04:47:00Z,,

The two USB-C ports on the left stopped working yesterday. I had been having trouble for a couple of days. The light would go off on the power brick when I plugged in the cable. I did a hardware scan and I checked for updated drivers. Nothing came up. I had read that it might be a short circuit. Fortunately, the port on the right side was working. Right after I read your post, I checked to see if the other two ports still weren't working. Now they are both working! I did check for software updates and there were a couple that I took. (not sure why because I get the automatic updates).

Anyway, all of my ports are working now.",2026-01-20T18:39:00Z,,

Unfortunately, even removing the back cover, disconnecting the battery, pressing the power button to de-energize the board/USB-Cs, and reconnecting the power cable did not work.

I tried several by different combinations of power connection with and without battery connect, but in all cases when the power block is connected no charging happens and the power block LED goes off indicating it is in protection mode.

Unless there are other suggestions, next step will be to have Dell or someone look at the unit.
